    "- In the group assignment you will form a team of up to 3 students (minimum 2) and participate in a forecasting competition on Kaggle\n",
    "- The goal is to predict listed prices of Airbnb properties in Melbourne based on various Airbnb characteristics and regression models\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will:  \n",
    "    - Write a problem statement and perform Exploratory Data Analysis  \n",
    "    - Clean up data, deal with categorical features and missing observations, and create new variables (feature engineering)  \n",
    "    - Construct and tune forecasting models, produce forecasts and submit your predictions to Kaggle  \n",
    "    - Each member of the team will record a video presentation of their work  \n",
    "    - Marks will be awarded producing a prediction in the top 5 positions of their unit as well as for reaching the highest ranking on Kaggle amongst all teams."
